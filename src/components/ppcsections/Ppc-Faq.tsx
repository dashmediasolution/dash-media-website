    question: "What exactly is Pay Per Click (PPC)?",
    answer: "It’s a straightforward way to buy traffic for your website. Instead of hoping people find you organically, you pay a small fee every time someone actually clicks on your ad. It’s a bidding system where you show up exactly when people search for specific terms that matter to your business.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer Pay Per Click audits?",
    answer: "We do. If you feel like you’re throwing money into a black hole, a digital marketing agency in USA can look into your account. We’ll find the leaks in your budget and show you exactly how to tweak your settings to get more bang for your buck on platforms like Google or Meta.",
  },
  {
    question: "What actually happens during a PPC audit?",
    answer: "We analyze your campaign down to the last detail to identify what costs are being wasted. We analyze your keyword targeting and landing pages. In the end, you receive the roadmap to declutter your campaign and increase your marketing efficiency to the maximum.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to see results?",
    answer: "The ads themselves can go live and start getting clicks within hours. However, real, \"bankable\" results usually take a bit of time to settle in. A professional digital marketing agency in USA will typically spend the first 3 to 6 months testing and optimizing to make sure the campaign is as profitable as possible.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much is a PPC campaign actually going to cost me?",
    answer: "There’s no flat rate because every industry is different. While some clicks cost a few cents, highly competitive ones can be much pricier. Most small businesses start with somewhere between a few hundred and a few thousand dollars a month. We help you find the sweet spot for pay per click services in USA that hit your goals without breaking the bank.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I control how much I spend each day?",
    answer: "Absolutely. One of the best parts about Pay Per Click Services in USA is that you control everything. You can set a strict daily cap so you never spend a penny more than you planned. Whether you want to scale up during a busy season or dial it back on the weekends, a professional digital marketing agency in USA can adjust your limits instantly to keep your budget in check.",
